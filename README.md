## Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Node.js installed (which includes npm). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imanistewart/hire-me-website
    cd hire-me-website
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the necessary dependencies listed there (both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Alternatively, if you prefer using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install

Once the installation is complete, you should be able to run the development server using the scripts defined in your `package.json` (e.g., `npm run dev`).

4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start # or python manage.py runserver, etc.
    ```
